[entity-description]
paddle-steamer=Fuel-burning transport vessel
ironclad=Fuel-burning transport vessel with a cannon
raft=Sailing Vessel, requires a very small amount of fuel. Only effective downwind
dock=Still WIP, don't waste resources on this yet
oil-rig=Able to pump up sea oil from ocean spouts. Has a higher minimum yield than pumpjacks
ocean-power-pole=Far more powerful than a regular power pole. Can only be placed over water
tile-face-north=Motorized Ships that pass over this tile will have their speed and direction set automatically at the cost of fuel
tile-face-west=Motorized Ships that pass over this tile will have their speed and direction set automatically at the cost of fuel
tile-face-east=Motorized Ships that pass over this tile will have their speed and direction set automatically at the cost of fuel
tile-face-south=Motorized Ships that pass over this tile will have their speed and direction set automatically at the cost of fuel
