# Ocean-Liners-Factorio
This mods adds ships to Factorio.

Drivable ships to sail across the oceans. You can even use landfill from within a ship!

Ideas: <br>

Side Cannons On Frigates <br>
Docks - Can take inserters, boat stays near, player deposited in same location <br>
Sailing Ships - acceleration dependent on Wind <br>
Paths between docks. - sounds hard ;) <br>
Pump-able Oil Spouts in the Ocean (Yay!) <br>

Current TODO <br>

Make fish shootable <br>
Faster Ironclad cannon shots <br>
Add a dock which is of type pump to start with - has to be placed by the ocean <br>


Installation <br>
Download as a zip and make sure to save it as 'OceanLiner_1.4.0'
Put the zip in your mods folder! <br>
For me it's it's %appdata% -> .roaming/factorio and on linux it's ~/.factorio I believe.
