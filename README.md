# Ocean-Liners-Factorio
This mods adds ships to Factorio.

Drivable ships to sail across the oceans. You can even use landfill from within a ship!

#Ideas: <br>

* Side Cannons On Frigates <br>
* Docks - Can take inserters, boat stays near, player deposited in same location <br>
* Sailing Ships - acceleration dependent on Wind <br>
* Paths between docks. - sounds hard - maybe with invisible rails ;) <br>
* Pump-able Oil Spouts in the Ocean (Yay!) <br>
* Quays <br>


#Current TODO <br>

* Make fish shootable - maybe need to overwrite them in entity or something like that - otherwise have the selector in lua 
* Faster Ironclad cannon shots
* Add separate oil pump (separate to the dock which pumps oil) and add spouts <br>
* Turret Parallax <br>
* Sea oil configurable at new game screen <br>
* Dock functionality - pulls in ships when player gets out nearby <br>
* Dock + ship textures <br>
